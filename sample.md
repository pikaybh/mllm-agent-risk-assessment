"raw":"1. **Risk Factor**: Exposure to Falling Objects  
   **Risk Rating**: 12  
   **Risk Reduction Measures**: 
   - Implement Drop Zones: Designate specific areas on the site where tools or materials can be stored or set down safely. Use physical barriers to keep pedestrians away from these zones.
   - Enhanced PPE: Require the use of hard hats at all times in construction zones.
   - Rigorous Training: Conduct training sessions on the proper securing of tools and materials, and the importance of using tool lanyards.
   - Regular Inspections: Establish regular site inspections for any potential overhead hazards.

2. **Risk Factor**: Unstable Work Surfaces  
   **Risk Rating**: 9  
   **Risk Reduction Measures**: 
   - Surface Stabilization: Before beginning work, ensure all surfaces are leveled and stable. Use materials that provide a firm footing.
   - Frequent Safety Checks: Conduct daily inspections of surfaces where work is being performed to identify and correct any instability.
   - Clear Marking: Clearly mark areas that are deemed unsafe, and provide effective signage indicating restricted areas. 

3. **Risk Factor**: Improper Use of Equipment  
   **Risk Rating**: 12  
   **Risk Reduction Measures**: 
   - Comprehensive Training: Ensure that all equipment operators undergo thorough training specific to the machinery being used, including a demonstration of proper use.
   - Preventive Maintenance: Develop a scheduled maintenance plan to ensure that all tools and equipment are inspected regularly and kept in safe working conditions.
   - Use of Checklists: Implement a checklist for equipment setup prior to each use, ensuring all safety features are functioning.

4. **Risk Factor**: Electrical Hazards  
   **Risk Rating**: 8  
   **Risk Reduction Measures**:
   - Utility Location Protocol: Establish a protocol to identify and mark all underground and overhead utility lines prior to digging or construction work.
   - Use Ground Fault Interrupters: Require the use of GFCI for all portable electrical tools and ensure fixed wiring is properly maintained.
   - Electrical Safety Training: Provide training focused on identifying and mitigating electrical hazards, including proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) procedures.

5. **Risk Factor**: Insufficient Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)  
   **Risk Rating**: 6  
   **Risk Reduction Measures**: 
   - Mandatory PPE Use: Require all site workers to wear appropriate PPE at all times (hard hats, gloves, safety goggles, non-slip footwear).
   - Regular Evaluations: Conduct regular evaluations of PPE compliance and educate workers on the importance of wearing PPE correctly.
   - Supply Distribution: Ensure easy access to PPE within the worksite and establish a system for immediate reporting and replacement of any worn or defective equipment.

By implementing these measures, the Risk Ratings of the identified factors can be effectively reduced to acceptable levels, enhancing overall safety on the construction site."

If proper safety measures (like secure fastening or protective barriers) are not adhered to, tools or materials could slip and fall on workers below.\n   - **Consequences**: Serious injuries can occur, including head trauma, fractures, or even fatalities. Additionally, property damage may occur to equipment or nearby structures.\n\n2. **Risk Factor**: **Unstable Work Surfaces**\n   - **Risk Scenario**: The ground conditions at the construction site might be uneven or muddy, which can cause the formwork to become unstable during installation. Workers shifting weight on soft or sloped ground may cause accidental slips or falls.\n   - **Consequences**: This can lead to sprains, fractures, or falls from heights when working on the formwork. Equipment may also be damaged if it falls or tips over due to instability.\n\n3. **Risk Factor**: **Improper Use of Equipment**\n   - **Risk Scenario**: Workers may not be adequately trained on using cranes or forklifts for lifting heavy formwork components. If they attempt to use machinery without thorough knowledge or protocols, accidents such as tipping over could occur.\n   - **Consequences**: Improper operation can cause severe injuries to operators or nearby workers, potential fatalities, damage to machinery, and costly delays to project timelines.\n\n4. **Risk Factor**: **Electrical Hazards**\n   - **Risk Scenario**: If power lines are located near the worksite, workers operating cranes or metal formwork may accidentally come into contact with live electrical wires during lifting operations.\n   - **Consequences**: This can lead to electrical shocks or electrocution, which may be fatal. There is also a risk of starting fires, which could endanger the entire worksite and personnel.\n\n5. **Risk Factor**: **Insufficient Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**\n   - **Risk Scenario**: Workers may not be provided or may neglect to wear appropriate PPE such as helmets, gloves, and safety boots while installing beam formwork.\n   - **Consequences**: Injury severity is increased in the event of an accident. Workers may sustain cuts, abrasions, or head injuries that could have been mitigated with proper PPE. Legal ramifications could also arise from safety regulation violations.\n\nThese structured hazard identifications will ensure the safety of the crew during the Beam formwork installation process at the site, contributing to comprehensive risk management practices.', pydantic=None, json_dict=None, agent='Crew Manager', output_format=<OutputFormat.RAW: 'raw'>)"

No injury or injuries requiring first aid only / Minor damage to the object (or adjacent structures) with no impact on the construction period. 2. Minor incidents, including non-disabling injuries / Minor damage to the object (or adjacent structures) causing a construction period loss of within 3 days. 3. Disabling injuries / Serious damage to the object (or adjacent structures) causing a construction period loss of more than one week. 4.
